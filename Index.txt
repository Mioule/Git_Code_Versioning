Key Concepts of Git:
Repository: A Git repository is a .git directory within your project folder that stores all the history and metadata for your project, including all file versions and commit information.

Commit: A commit represents a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Each commit includes a message describing the changes made, the author, and a unique identifier.

Branching: Branches allow developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase. When a feature is complete, the branch can be merged back into the main branch.

Merging: Merging combines the changes from one branch into another.

Staging Area (Index): The staging area is an intermediate area where you prepare changes before committing them. You add files to the staging area to include them in the next commit.

Remote Repository: A remote repository, often hosted on platforms like GitHub, or Bitbucket, is a shared version of your project that allows for collaboration and centralized storage.
